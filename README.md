PLAN
Start with the HTML to sketch out the basic layout from the Header section down to the footer.  For each section of the HTML, get all of the content needed for that section onto the page before moving on to the next section. Then work on the CSS, again from the Header down to the footer.  Modify the HTML as needed while working the CSS.  Then revisit both files as needed to add fininshing touches.
